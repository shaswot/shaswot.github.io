This paper discusses how FPGAs offer true hardware parallelism and deliberates on
some areas which benefit from FPGAsâ€™ parallel processing such as DSP (Digital Signal Processing), Data Acquisition and
Processing, Text Parsing and Image/Video Processing. To demonstrate the possibility and the consequent advantages of
parallel processing, a matrix multiplier was designed for a Spartan-3E FPGA with the help of High Level Synthesis (HLS)
tools. Two possible solutions, with and without parallel processing, were obtained which are briefly discussed here.
