In the near future, Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of billions and trillions of nodes. Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Nodes (EHWSN) play a critical role in forming a
sustainable, maintenance-free network of perpetually communicating autonomous devices for the IoT infrastructure. Energy autonomy (neutrality) of the sensor nodes
needs to be ensured for perpetual operation. Here we consider a case of a solar energy harvesting sensor node.
